Blogger - my first app. It's done whithin The Odin Project with tutorial http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

To make sure that everyone could login and try my app I blocked from deleting and changing first article with instructions and first author, whos email and password everyone can get from the first artickle 'README'. To get off this blocking you need modify actions destroy and update in articles_controller.rb and authors_controller.rb and modify articles/show.html.erb and authors/show.html.erb - find statements about Article.first and Author.first and delete them.

* Ruby version - 2.3.3
